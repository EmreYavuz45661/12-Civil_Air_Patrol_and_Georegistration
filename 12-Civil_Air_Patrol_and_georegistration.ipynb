    "In the previous session, we saw how a series of 2D images taken of a 3D scene can be used to recover the 3D information, by exploiting geometric constraints of the cameras. Now the question is, how do we take this technique and apply it in a disaster response scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at a specific case study, using images from the Low Altitude Disaster Imagery (LADI) dataset, taken by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). As we work with this dataset, keep in mind the two major questions from the previous lecture:\n",

    "## Civil Air Patrol\n",
    "Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is the civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF). The origins of CAP date back to the pre-World War II era. As the Axis powers became a growing threat to the world, civilian aviators in the United States feared that the government would shut down general aviation as a precautionary measure. These aviators thus had to prove to the federal government that civilian aviation was not only not a danger, but actually a benefit to the war effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these efforts, two separate programs were created. One was a Civilian Pilot Training Program, intended to increase the available people that could operate an aircraft should the need to deploy additional troops arise. The second actually called for the organization of civilian aviators and opened the door to the creation of CAP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the United States entered WWII proper, CAP began to embark a plethora of activities, some of which are still practiced today. They continued to do cadet education programs. They also began patrolling the coasts and borders. Finally, they started in 1942 conducting search and rescue (SAR) missions. These missions were a resounding success, and one of the main components of CAP today.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP has five congressionally mandated missions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) To provide an organization toâ€”\n",
    "(A) encourage and aid citizens of the United States in contributing their efforts, services, and resources in developing aviation and in maintaining air supremacy; and\n",
    "(B) encourage and develop by example the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) To provide aviation education and training especially to its senior and cadet members.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) To encourage and foster civil aviation in local communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) To provide an organization of private citizens with adequate facilities to assist in meeting local and national emergencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) To assist the Department of the Air Force in fulfilling its noncombat programs and missions.\n",

    "CAP's main series of missions revolve around emergency response. CAP is involved in roughly 85% of all SAR missions in the United States and its territories. After natural disasters, CAP is responsible for assessing damage in affected communities, delivering supplies, providing transportation, in addition to its usual SAR missions. \n",

    "Part of their emergency programming is taking aerial imagery of affected areas. This imagery is the highest resolution, most timely imagery that we have available of a post-disaster situation. Even the highest resolution satellite imagery is often either limited in their geographical coverage, not very timely or occluded by clouds. These are images taken of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n",

    "## The LADI dataset\n",
    "Part of the effort in making CAP imagery more useful is trying to make more sense of the content of the images. To that end, researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory released the Low Altitude Disaster Imagery (LADI) dataset. This dataset contains hundreds of thousands of CAP images that have crowdsourced labels corresponding to infrastructure, environment and damage categories. This begins to answer the first of the two questions we set out initially. We'll start working on these labels tomorrow. For now, we will solely focus on the images themselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you have acquired $200,000 to implement some improvement to the way CAP takes aerial imagery. Hurricane season starts in five months, so whatever improvements need to be implemented by then. Separate into your breakout rooms and answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What specific hurdles to using CAP images do you want to address? Identify at least two.\n",
    "- Design a proposal to address the challenges you identified above, taking into account the budget and time constraints. Improvements can be of any sort (technical, political, social, etc).\n",
    "- What are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing your proposal?\n",
    "- Identify at least three different stakeholder groups in this situation. What are their specific needs? How does your proposal address these needs? How does your proposal fall short?\n",
    "- Draw out a budget breakdown and a timeline. Prepare to present these in 30 mins."
